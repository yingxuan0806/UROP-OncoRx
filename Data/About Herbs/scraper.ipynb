Alfalfa seeds also contain a toxic amino acid, L-canavanine. Levels of this amino acid vary widely across various cultivations of plants, and decrease as the plant matures.

It is also thought that the enzymes present in wheat grass help\\xa0rid the body of toxins and carcinogens. However, none of these claims is backed by scientific studies.', 'Wheat grass is not known to cause any serious side effects. However, the juice\\xa0can be contaminated with mold or bacteria as the leaves are grown for 7–10 days before the juice is extracted.'], ['Wild yam has not been shown to prevent or treat cancer.<br/><br/>Wild yam contains a compound called diosgenin that mimics estrogen and progesterone in animals. Diosgenin can be converted into active steroid compounds in the lab. Small studies using different species and formulas of wild yam extract have had mixed results on menopausal symptoms. Another small study suggests that increasing yam intake through diet may improve sex hormone and cholesterol levels. A lab study showed that wild yam extract has weak hormonal activity against human breast cancer cells, but this does not mean it can prevent or treat cancer.', 'More studies are needed to confirm whether wild yam or its extract actually has any benefits. Because wild yam has estrogenic effects, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should talk to their physicians before consumption.'], ['Willow bark\\xa0is\\xa0useful in\\xa0relieving\\xa0muscle and joint pain, but may have side effects similar to aspirin.<br/><br/>Willow bark is commonly used to treat pain and reduce fevers. It contains a compound called salicin that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects. Several studies have shown that willow bark extracts are effective in reducing back pain and osteoarthritis.', 'Although aspirin is developed from salicin, a direct comparison between aspirin benefits and willow bark benefits cannot be made. At the same time, aspirin-like side effects may occur with willow bark.'], ['Yohimbe is not recommended for treating erectile dysfunction (ED).<br/><br/>Yohimbe is a tree native to West Africa. Yohimbine, an alkaloid derived from the bark of Yohimbe tree, has been used for many years as an aphrodisiac. Although widely used to treat erectile dysfunction before the approval of newer drugs, current guidelines do not recommend its use. In addition, yohimbine can cause many side effects, interact with many prescription drugs, and is not recommended for individuals with certain medical conditions.'], ['Yunnan Baiyao is a traditional Chinese Medicine formula used for wound healing, as a pain releiver and to stop bleeding. It has not yet been shown to treat cancer.', 'Yunnan Baiyao (YNBY; “<em>White medicine from the Province of Yunnan</em>” in Mandarin) is a well-known proprietary traditional Chinese medicine product. The original formula is believed to contain several herbs with notoginseng as the major ingredient. It is promoted as a dietary supplement that can be used both externally and internally to stop bleeding and to treat cancer in humans and in animals. It is also claimed to provide relief from minor aches and pains of muscles and joints associated with backache, arthritis, strains, bruises, sprains, and frostbite.', 'Studies done in the lab and in animals show that YNBY and notoginseng have hemostatic, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Notoginseng also demonstrated anticoagulant properties.', 'Clinical studies suggest that YNBY may be effective in treating bleeding in the uterus, ulcer in the colon and on the skin. It also reduced blood loss during some surgical procedures. Case reports indicate that YNBY reduced bleeding in cancer patients, but it has not been studied as a cancer treatment.'], ['Zeolites have not been shown to treat cancer or other conditions in humans.', 'Zeolites are minerals that contain mainly aluminum and silicon compounds. They are used as drying agents, in detergents, and in water and air purifiers. Zeolites are also marketed as dietary supplements to treat cancer, diarrhea, autism, herpes, and hangover, and to balance pH and remove heavy metals in the body. However, there are no published human data to support these uses. Further, the FDA has issued several warning letters to distributors for misleading claims about zeolite products. Erionite, a type of fibrous zeolite, can cause certain types of lung cancer when inhaled.'], ['Zestra may improve sexual function in normal women and in those suffering from female sexual disorders.<br/><br/>Zestra is a personal product for women that contains <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/borage\">borage</a> seed oil, <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/evening-primrose-oil\">evening primrose oil</a>, <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/dong-quai\">angelica</a> root extract, <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/forskolin\"><em>Coleus forskohlii</em></a> extract, ascorbyl palmitate, and <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/vitamin-e\">dl-alpha tocopherol.</a>. It is being promoted to relieve symptoms of female sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction may include painful intercourse, loss of desire, and difficulty in achieving arousal or orgasm. Stress, changes in hormone, cancer treatment, drugs, or menopause are some of the factors that can cause sexual dysfunction. Scientists believe that the borage, evening primrose, angelica, and Coleus forskohlii may be responsible for Zestra’s activity. A small study showed that Zestra can improve sexual function in both normal women and in those suffering from female sexual arousal disorder.', 'Zestra has not been studied in cancer patients. Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or those trying to get pregnant should not use Zestra.'], ['<strong>Zinc supplementation may reduce the length of a cold when taken within 24 hours of symptoms. Studies examining whether zinc can help symptoms from cancer treatment produced mixed results.', 'Zinc is necessary for normal cell functioning, nerve signaling, and for the body to protect itself against infection or disease. Scientists think that zinc lozenges may prevent the common cold virus from attaching to the nasal cavities, windpipe, and lungs.\\xa0Zinc interacts with the outer layer of the virus and prevents its ability to grow into full-blown virus particles in lab tests.', 'Zinc may help to reduce some symptoms caused by radiation therapy in head and neck cancer patients. It was also shown to improve survival in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Optimal levels of zinc may also reduce the risk of various cancers, but further study is needed.'], ['Zyflamend has not been shown to treat cancer. Studies in humans are very limited.', 'Zyflamend is an herbal supplement consisting of Holy basil, <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/turmeric\"><u>turmeric</u></a>, <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/ginger\"><u>ginger</u></a>, <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/green-tea\"><u>green tea</u></a>, rosemary, hu zhang, <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/huanglian\"><u>Chinese goldthread</u></a>, barberry, oregano, and <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/scutellaria-baicalensis\"><u>skullcap</u></a>. Promoters of Zyflamend claim that it has anti-inflammatory and antiaging effects. In a few in lab studies, it has been shown to reduce inflammation and levels of certain enzymes that produce estrogen. It can also cause cell death. Results from a small study indicate it may help lower prostate specific antigen (PSA), a marker of prostate cancer. More research is needed.']]\n"
