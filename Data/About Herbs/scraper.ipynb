A few case reports show that it can decrease fatigue in cancer patients.', 'Because Sutherlandia may be able to fight HIV virus, it is being proposed as an AIDS treatment in Africa. However in a trial of adults with HIV, patients taking\\xa0Sutherlandia did not experience benefits, but did have longer\\xa0infection times. Additional studies are needed.'], ['Preliminary data suggest<em> Synsepalum dulcificum</em> may change taste sensation from sour to sweet in\\xa0patients undergoing chemotherapy, but it has not been shown to prevent weight loss.<br/><br/><em>Synsepalum dulcificum</em> is a West African plant that produces red berries commonly known as miracle fruit. A protein found in these berries can bind to the sweet taste receptors of the tongue. This causes many sour, acidic foods to taste sweet, and the effects may last for one to two hours. Miracle fruit has been proposed for use in taste changes caused by chemotherapy and for weight loss, but studies are quite limited. Data suggest that some patients undergoing chemotherapy reported improved taste, but no change in weight with miracle fruit.'], ['Taurine has been shown to help muscle function and may lower risk of cardiovascular disease.<br/><br/>Taurine is an amino acid present in many tissues of mammals that plays an important role in heart, muscle, and nervous system functioning. Taurine is obtained through diet by eating meat, dairy, and seafood products, and it can also be made in the body from the amino acid cysteine. Eating foods rich in taurine may lower cardiovascular risk.', 'In animal studies, taurine reduced muscle dysfunction and wasting from disuse, imbalances that prevent the natural detoxification processes, and nerve pain. In humans, taking taurine supplements before exercise reduced muscle damage after high-intensity exercise, but its effect on physical or mental performance has been mixed. It has also been shown that even though taurine levels can be increased in the muscles of rodents through oral supplementation, this does not occur in humans. In overweight and obese adults, taurine reduced inflammation and fat levels in the blood and improved fat and sugar metabolism. However, this has not translated into improvements in blood sugar or insulin response in Type 2 diabetes.', 'Taurine\\xa0is marketed as a dietary supplement and is also a major ingredient in many energy drinks.\\xa0There have been some toxic effects noted in animal studies and in humans when taken in excess amounts or with alcohol.'], ['Topical<strong> tea tree oil may be effective in treating certain skin conditions<strong>, but research is limited.<br/><br/>Tea tree oil is the essential oil distilled from <em>Melaleuca alternifolia,</em> a plant native to Australia. It has been used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties to treat various skin conditions and infections. It is also a popular ingredient in skin and hair products. In lab studies, tea tree oil killed several bacteria and fungi most commonly found in skin infections and acne.', 'Studies on the use of tea tree oil in humans are limited. In healthy volunteers, a topical tea tree oil extract reduced inflammation caused by histamine exposure. It has also shown some benefit in individuals with athleteâs foot, acne, cold sores, and warts, but more studies are needed.'], ['Tian Xian showed anticancer effects in laboratory studies and in animal models. Clinical data are needed to confirm such effects.<br/><br/>Tian Xian is an herbal extract used in traditional medicine and consists of the following herbs: <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/cordyceps\"><em>Cordyceps sinensis</em></a> (<em>Dong Chong Xia Cao</em>), <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/astragalus\"><em>Astragulus membranaceus</em></a> (<em>Huang Qi</em>), <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/reishi-mushroom\"><em>Ganoderma lucidum</em></a> (<em>Ling Zhi</em>), <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/ginseng-asian\"><em>Panax ginseng</em></a> (<em>Ren Shen</em>), <em>Atractylodes macrocephalae</em> (<em>Bai Zhu</em>), <em>Dioscorea batatas</em> (<em>Shan Yao</em>), <em>Codnopsis pilosula</em> (<em>Dang Shen</em>), <em>Pogostemon cablin</em> (<em>Huo Xiang</em>), <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/lycium\"><em>Lycium barbarum</em></a> (<em>Gou Qi Zi</em>), <em>Pteria margaritifera</em> (Pearl Powder), <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/ligustrum-lucidum\"><em>Ligustrum lucidum</em></a><em> Ait</em> (<em>Nu Zhen Zi</em>), and <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/licorice\"><em>Radix glycyrrhizae</em></a> (Licorice). Ingredients may vary depending on manufacturers.<br/><br/>Promoters of Tian Xian claim that it has immunomodulating and anticancer effects. Laboratory studies show that it can increase the number of immune cells upon stimulation with antigens, and also has anticancer effects. A small study in breast cancer patients suggests that it may improve quality of life and alleviate side effects associated with chemotherapy. Larger controlled trials are needed to confirm these effects and to determine safety.'], ['Transfer factors have not been shown to treat or prevent cancer.', 'Transfer factors are a group of proteins produced by cells of the\\xa0immune system. Some studies have shown that transfer factors can be used to treat\\xa0herpes, infections in children, chronic fatigue syndrome, and yeast infections. They may also boost the immune system in patients with AIDS. More research is needed to determine the anticancer effects of transfer factors.'], ['<span>Tribulus has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer in humans.</span>', 'Tribulus is an herb that grows in the subtropical regions of eastern and western Asia, southern Europe, and Africa. It is used in traditional medicine for chest pain, heart problems, dizziness, skin and eye disorders, to expel kidney stones, and as a diuretic and tonic. Tribulus is also marketed as a dietary supplement to improve sexual function and for body building due to the belief that it acts like testosterone in the body.\\xa0', 'Laboratory and animal studies show that tribulus has medicinal effects against high blood pressure, diabetes, inflammation, infection, and cancer.', 'The use of tribulus has been linked to adverse effects in both animals and humans. Due to its potential hormonal activities, prostate cancer patients should consult their physicians before using tribulus.'], ['Triphala has immunostimulatory effects and may help prevent gingivitis.<br/><br/>Triphala is an herbal formulation used in the Indian medicinal system of <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/ayurveda\">Ayurveda</a>.

Triphala is used for dental caries, anemia, jaundice, constipation, asthma, fever, chronic ulcers, inflammation, obesity, and to strengthen the immune system against infections such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and AIDS.'], ['Turmeric demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities in the lab. A few studies suggest that curcumin has biological activity in some cancer patients, but more data are needed to verify its benefits.<br/><br/>Turmeric is a spice that has been used in cooking for centuries. It has many biological activities, although how these effects occur is not fully understood. Lab experiments show that substances in turmeric, called curcuminoids, prevent inflammation by inhibiting the molecules that cause it. Curcuminoids may protect the body by enhancing the activity of an important detoxifying enzyme, and by neutralizing molecules that cause DNA damage, such as free radicals. In rats, turmeric prevented the development of kidney damage from toxins. Turmeric also stimulates the flow of bile in the gastrointestinal tract.<br/><br/>Animal studies have also shown that turmeric may have protective effects against colon, stomach, and skin cancers. Turmeric also stopped replication of tumor cells when applied directly to them in the lab, but it is unknown if this effect occurs in the human body. Curcumin, a curcuminoid, has shown biological activity in pancreatic cancer patients and there are ongoing studies to test its effect as an addition to current cancer treatment. However, recent experiments suggest turmeric may interfere with the activity of some chemotherapy drugs, so the question remains whether this spice is helpful or harmful during chemotherapy. Curcumin also showed weak phytoestrogenic activity in a laboratory study. Human data are needed to determine the clinical relevance.', 'Patients with gastrointestinal disorders and those predisposed to kidney stone formation should consult their physicians before using turmeric supplements.'], ['Ukrain has not been shown to prevent or treat cancer, but may be useful as palliative care in some instances.<br/><br/>Ukrain is an alkaloid extract from the plant <em>Chelidonium majus</em>, a common weed. It was developed over 20 years ago by a scientist from the Ukraine, who tested the product on patients with several different types of cancers. In lab experiments, Ukrain was found to kill cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone. This may occur by disrupting changes in cell structure during cell division. Because cancer cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells, such a disruption could slow the growth of cancer cells, causing their death. Some lab experiments suggest that Ukrain may stimulate certain aspects of the immune system, but it is uncertain if these effects could occur in humans. Two small studies suggest Ukrain may be helpful for advanced pancreatic cancer patients, but additional studies are needed to confirm effects and safety.'], ['There is no scientific evidence to support the use of usnic acid for weight loss. Supplements containing usnic acid are associated with severe liver toxicity.<br/><br/>Usnic acid is a compound found in lichens. It has been used as a preservative in moisturizing creams, and as an ingredient in toothpastes, mouthwashes, and deodorants because of its antibacterial properties. Dietary supplements that contain usnic acid are promoted for weight loss but scientific evidence is lacking. The supplements have also been associated with liver toxicity.'], ['Valerian may provide modest improvements in sleep, but study results are mixed.<br/><br/>In laboratory experiments, valerian extract prevents the breakdown of an important inhibitory neurotransmitter chemical in the nervous system, causing a calming effect. Human studies suggest valerian products have a modest effect to improve sleep quality. Valerian supplements often have a distinct odor that some may find unpleasant, and these products might interact with a number of drugs or health conditions. More research is needed to determine the benefits and safety of this botanical.'], ['There is no scientific evidence that Viacreme can enhance sexual pleasure in women.<br/><br/>Viacreme is a topical cream that contains menthol and L-arginine. It is being promoted to increase sexual response in women by sensitizing the genital area. Many cancer patients may have painful intercourse and difficulty in maintaining arousal resulting from stress, hormonal changes, cancer treatments, or use of antidepressants. The manufacturer claims application of Viacreme in the clitoral region results in genital warming and increased clitoral sensitivity. The L-arginine increases blood flow to the genital tissue. However, this claim is not supported by clinical studies and the positive results of Viacreme may be due to a placebo effect. This product has not been studied in cancer patients.'], ['Vinpocetine may be useful against some cerebrovascular disorders, but additional studies are needed. It has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer.', 'Vinpocetine is made from a compound found in the common periwinkle plant. It was developed in Europe as a drug but sold in the United States as a dietary supplement to improve brain function. Vinpocetine was shown to increase blood flow to the brain and has been studied as a treatment for Alzheimerâs disease and for disorders of the nervous and circulatory systems. However, more studies are needed before it can be recommended. Vinpocetine should not be confused with the chemotherapy drugs vincristine and vinblastine, which are also made from compounds of the periwinkle plant.'], ['Vitamin A is essential for many bodily functions. It is unclear if taking extra vitamin A can prevent cancer.', 'Vitamin A is best obtained from a well-balanced diet. Obtaining the recommended Daily Value of vitamin A (DV: 5,000 IU) is essential for a variety of bodily functions, including vision, embryonic development, tissue integrity, and proper immune activation.', 'Many fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamin A precursors, such as beta-carotene and cryptoxanthin, which are converted into the active form retinol. Dairy products, eggs, and fish are among the foods containing vitamin A already preformed as retinol. Too much retinol can cause a variety of side effects.', 'Scientists are studying vitamin A byproducts that may be useful in cancer therapies, but these treatments are different from extra vitamin A taken in the form of supplements, the overuse of which can produce harmful effects including liver problems.'], ['Vitamin B12, in combination with folate and vitamin B6, may reduce the risk for some cancers.', 'Vitamin B12 is involved in the synthesis of phospholipids, neurotransmitters, DNA, and the metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids in cells. It is found in meat, fish, dairy products, and fortified cereals. A number of studies have evaluated B12, <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/folate\">folic acid</a>, and <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/vitamin-b6\">B6</a> as part of homocysteine-lowering therapy. This is because elevated homocysteine levels can be a marker for various conditions including heart disease, depression, cognitive disorders, and risk of fracture incidence. However, findings are mixed on whether long-term supplementation with this combination improves fracture risk or medical conditions even when it lowers homocysteine levels.', 'Some large studies suggest this supplement combination may lower the risks for cervical cancer, but not lung or invasive cancers, and results are mixed for breast cancer. Another study found an increased cancer incidence when evaluating only B12 taken with folic acid, although results suggested these effects were related to folic acid. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.', 'Since vitamin B12 is found in many foods, deficiency is more common in the elderly, strict vegetarians, or those who take oral contraceptives, or medications for gastric disorders or insulin resistance. High levels of folic acid intake may mask a B12 deficiency. Patients should discuss supplement use with their physicians.'], ['Obtaining vitamin B6 through diet may help to reduce the risk of certain cancers, but using B6 supplements does not prevent cancer or reduce chemotherapy side effects.', 'Vitamin B6 is necessary for many physiological processes in the human body. These include reactions of cellular respiration, the release of glucose stores, and amino acid metabolism. Getting B6 through diet along with other nutrients is associated with cancer-preventive effects, but it cannot reduce side effects from chemotherapy. Even though lab studies show that B6 can have protective effects, high levels can also be toxic and cause nerve damage. In addition, a large\\xa0analysis of postmenopausal women found that combined high intakes of B6 and <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/vitamin-b12\">B12</a>, were associated with an unexpected increased risk of hip fracture.', 'B6 is readily available in food and deficiencies are uncommon. If a deficiency is suspected, it is important to see a healthcare practitioner to ensure correct diagnosis and supplement dosage.'], ['Vitamin C is important for maintaining general health, but vitamin C supplementation may not help lower the risk of cancer.', 'Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that must be gained from sources outside the human body. It is an antioxidant used for colds and for cancer prevention because it is thought to protect cells from free radical damage. It is also important for the production of proteins and formation of collagen in the skin. Therefore, vitamin C helps promote wound healing and a deficiency can cause scurvy. In addition, scientists think that vitamin C might help reduce inflammation.', 'Oral vitamin C supplements are not an effective cancer treatment. Clinical studies using high doses of injectable vitamin C do show promising results, but more studies are needed. Vitamin C may also make some chemotherapy drugs less effective. Patients should speak with their doctor before using vitamin C, especially during cancer treatment.'], ['Adequate vitamin D intake is needed for bone health and other important biologic functions. There are links between increased vitamin D intake and reduced risk of breast and colorectal cancers, but protection against other cancers remains unclear.', 'Vitamin D is an essential vitamin that is found in certain foods such as fortified milk and cereals, egg yolks, and fish. It is also produced in skin that is exposed to sunlight. Its primary function is to maintain adequate blood calcium and phosphorus levels by increasing absorption of these minerals from the diet through the small intestine. When dietary <a href=\"/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/calcium\"><u>calcium</u></a> intake is too low, vitamin D helps move calcium stores from the bones into the blood.', 'Vitamin D is also involved in many other biologic functions such as immune and hormone regulation. Intake of vitamin D through diet may protect against breast or colorectal cancers or improve markers of prostate cancer. However,\\xa0other factors may contribute to these benefits, such as better diet and lifestyle habits. In addition,\\xa0high blood levels of vitamin D may increase risks of pancreatic\\xa0or aggressive prostate cancer in some cases. Effects against other cancers remain unclear.\\xa0', 'The Institute of Medicine recommends a higher Dietary Allowance of vitamin D at 600 IU/day with the Upper level Intake at 4,000 IU/day for bone health. Scientists know that it is helpful to take vitamin D supplements when patients are deficient in this vitamin. Certain populations including cancer patients can be especially prone to this deficiency. However, there is some debate about the right\\xa0amount needed. There is also a possible connection between taking vitamin D plus calcium and an increased risk for kidney stones, so patients should check with their doctors if they feel they arenât getting enough.'], ['A diet containing adequate amounts of vitamin E is important in maintaining general health, and may prevent against some forms of cancer. The ability of vitamin E to prevent or treat Alzheimerâs disease or heart disease requires further study.<br/><br/>Vitamin E, also known as alpha-tocopherol, is a natural antioxidant that is found in foods such as plant oils, eggs, nuts, green leafy vegetables, and whole grains. Its major function is to neutralize free radicals, meaning that it protects cells from their damaging effects. Therefore, vitamin E is being investigated in conditions such as Alzheimerâs disease and cancer, in which free radical damage is known to play a part.<br/><br/>Clinical trials show that vitamin E supplementation does not help prevent cardiovascular disease, and it may increase risk for a certain kind of stroke. Data on whether it can reduce cancer risk are also mixed, and under some circumstances taking vitamin E supplements may actually increase risk. For chronic disease prevention including conditions such as heart disease and cancer, a meta-analysis concludes that nutrients like vitamin E are best obtained from the diet.'], ['Vitamin O does not treat or cure cancer.<br/><br/>Vitamin O is a dietary supplement that is marketed on the Internet. Supporters claim that it contains a high concentration of oxygen molecules (30,000 parts per million) dissolved in distilled water. This\\xa0is unlikely because the maximum solubility of oxygen in water at room temperature is only 7500 parts per million.', 'Vitamin O can be classified as an oxygen therapy because it is based on the idea that cancer and many other diseases are caused by a build-up of toxins in the body due to pollution, processed foods, and other factors. Promoters believe that by supplying high levels of oxygen to the body, vitamin O can detoxify the organs and kill cancer cells.', 'Studies in animal have shown that inhaling oxygen-rich air has anticancer activities. However, oxygen is absorbed through the lungs. Taking oxygen supplements by mouth is unlikely to have the same effect.'], ['Fermented wheat germ was shown to improve quality of life in cancer patients. More studies are needed.<br/><br/>Fermented wheat germ extract (WGE) was developed by Mate Hidvegi, a Hungarian chemist, in the 1990s. It should not be confused with wheat germ oil. WGE is used as a dietary supplement by cancer patients in Hungary to improve quality of life. Laboratory studies show that WGE may have anticancer properties. Results from some clinical trials suggest WGE improves quality of life, but cancer patients should consult their physicians before taking WGE.'], ['Wheat grass juice has not been shown effective in treating cancer or AIDS.<br/><br/>The juice extracted from the leaves of wheat grass is believed to prevent tooth decay, reduce high blood pressure and arthritis pain, and treat chronic fatigue syndrome and the common cold. It is also being promoted as a cure for cancer and AIDS. Proponents of wheat grass believe that the chlorophyll present in the leaves increases hemoglobin content in the blood because both molecules are similar in structure. It is also thought that the enzymes present in wheat grass help\\xa0rid the body of toxins and carcinogens. However, none of these claims is backed by scientific studies.', 'Wheat grass is not known to cause any serious side effects. However, the juice\\xa0can be contaminated with mold or bacteria as the leaves are grown for 7â10 days before the juice is extracted.'], ['Wild yam has not been shown to prevent or treat cancer.<br/><br/>Wild yam contains a compound called diosgenin that mimics estrogen and progesterone in animals. Diosgenin can be converted into active steroid compounds in the lab. Small studies using different species and formulas of wild yam extract have had mixed results on menopausal symptoms. Another small study suggests that increasing yam intake through diet may improve sex hormone and cholesterol levels. A lab study showed that wild yam extract has weak hormonal activity against human breast cancer cells, but this does not mean it can prevent or treat cancer.', 'More studies are needed to confirm whether wild yam or its extract actually has any benefits. Because wild yam has estrogenic effects, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should talk to their physicians before consumption.'], ['Willow bark\\xa0is\\xa0useful in\\xa0relieving\\xa0muscle and joint pain, but may have side effects similar to aspirin.<br/><br/>Willow bark is commonly used to treat pain and reduce fevers. It contains a compound called salicin that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects. Several studies have shown that willow bark extracts are effective in reducing back pain and osteoarthritis.', 'Although aspirin is developed from salicin, a direct comparison between aspirin benefits and willow bark benefits cannot be made. At the same time, aspirin-like side effects may occur with willow bark.'], ['Yohimbe is not recommended for treating erectile dysfunction (ED).<br/><br/>Yohimbe is a tree native to West Africa. Yohimbine, an alkaloid derived from the bark of Yohimbe tree, has been used for many years as an aphrodisiac.

It is also claimed to provide relief from minor aches and pains of muscles and joints associated with backache, arthritis, strains, bruises, sprains, and frostbite.', 'Studies done in the lab and in animals show that YNBY and notoginseng have hemostatic, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Notoginseng also demonstrated anticoagulant properties.', 'Clinical studies suggest that YNBY may be effective in treating bleeding in the uterus, ulcer in the colon and on the skin. It also reduced blood loss during some surgical procedures. Case reports indicate that YNBY reduced bleeding in cancer patients, but it has not been studied as a cancer treatment.'], ['Zeolites have not been shown to treat cancer or other conditions in humans.', 'Zeolites are minerals that contain mainly aluminum and silicon compounds. They are used as drying agents, in detergents, and in water and air purifiers. Zeolites are also marketed as dietary supplements to treat cancer, diarrhea, autism, herpes, and hangover, and to balance pH and remove heavy metals in the body.
